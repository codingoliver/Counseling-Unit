				<h2>I got help from an empathic counsellor</h2>
				<p class="first">How a counsellor works is very important, when choosing an online counsellor to work with, to entrust your deepest fears and secrets with, you will want to know a bit about the counsellor and how they work, Here is some background information which I hope will help you to connect and understand what its all about.</p>
				<p>Before I became a counsellor I found myself struggling with the changes and challenges that came into my life, life was no longer familiar. I didn’t know where to turn, I struggled alone with life and my issue for a while.</p>
				<p>Eventually I found the courage to talk to a counsellor. Obviously confidentiality was very important to me. I gained encouragement and support from a very experienced and empathic counsellor whose reason for being a counsellor was that she wanted to help people, and she did help me a lot, having counselling supported me into gaining some control back in my life and I began to live life again instead of merely existing.</p>

				<h2>The Humanistic Approach in Counselling</h2>
				<p class="first">These qualities cannot be learned from a text book, they are qualities within the counsellor as a person. Caring but with the ability to enter into the clients world, walk in their shoes , see through their eyes, whilst staying in their own world, with all of their skills.</p>
				<p>It would be no use at all having someone try to help us if they broke down and collapsed emotionally at our troubles, having said that, I have often shed a tear with clients, but that’s just the humanity and empathy I feel for people.</p>

				<h2>What other skills does a counsellor need?</h2>
				<p class="first">A counsellor needs to offer complete confidentiality, be skilled with and have a good understanding of how the human mind works. To be experienced and able to work with the wide variety of life challenges effecting people in today’s world, be caring and compassionate.</p>
				<p>These are a must in my opinion. To be honest most counsellor’s have these gifts and skills, but we need more. As a counsellor I need to enable clients to feel comfortable, to remove any barriers for them receiving the help they want and need.</p>

				<h2>So how does it actually work?</h2>
				<p class="first">A counsellor integrates a personal set of attributes, a caring nature, empathy and a ‘real’ desire to help other people. With an understanding gained through training of human development and how the mind works, how experiences and feelings are linked to how we think and behave.
					I will help you explore your perceptions of yourself and others behaviours and how to help you learn to see things as they really are.</p>
				<p>More than anything else though, a good counsellor needs to create a therapeutic relationship with their clients. A close and trusted bond which will help you by supporting you enough to allow you feel that you are in safe hands.
					The right counsellor will never judge you or make you feel ashamed, that someone is there for you throughout your struggles and your therapeutic journey. You will not feel alone once you start working with me.</p>

				<h2>Some Important Attributes Effective Counsellors Have</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Non judgemental</li>
					<li>Accepting</li>
					<li>Empathic</li>
				</ul>
				<p>I combine Humanistic Counselling or Person Centred Counselling as it is sometimes known with CBT (Cognitive Behavioural Therapy), to help clients out of crisis and reach their full potential faster,
					The important focus on the counselling relationship and the bond created is vital in my work.</p>
				<p>My approach to counselling is that <strong>you</strong> the client will always remain in control of what you would like to explore and how much you want to say.</p>
				<p>Also important is my belief that deep down we <strong>all</strong> have what we need to survive and fully function within us, we may just need someone to help us find these inner resources, so Person Centred Counselling makes up an important part of how I work.
