				<h2>What ADHD can feel like<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">Imagine living in a fast-moving kaleidoscope, where sounds, images, and thoughts are constantly shifting. Feeling easily bored, yet helpless to keep your mind on tasks you need to complete.
					Distracted by irrelevant sights and sounds, your mind drives you from one thought or activity to the next. Perhaps you are so wrapped up in a combination of thoughts and images that you do not notice when your being spoken to.
					unable to sit still, plan ahead, finish tasks, or be fully aware of what's going on around them.</p>
				<p>To family, classmates or co-workers, you seem to exist in a whirlwind of confused or frantic activity. Unexpectedly-on some days and in some situations-you may seem fine, often leading others to think the person with ADHD can actually control these behaviours.
					As a result, the disorder can ruin the person's relationships with others in addition to disrupting their daily life, and weakening self-esteem.</p>

				<h2>What ADHD can feel like<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">ADHD, once called hyperkinesia or minimal brain dysfunction, is one of the most common disorders among young people. Two to three times more boys than girls are affected.
					ADHD often continues into adolescence and adulthood, and can cause a lifetime of frustration and emotional pain.</p>
				<p>But there is help... and hope. In the last decade, scientists have learned much about the course of the disorder and are now able to identify and treat children, adolescents, and adults who have it.
					A variety of medications, behaviour-changing therapies, are already available to help people with ADHD focus their attention, build self-esteem, and function in new ways.</p>

				<h2>Counselling clients with ADHD<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">No two people with ADHD are alike each brings a unique set of characteristics and experiences that have interacted with their ADHD over the course of their lifetime.
					What they do have in common is a brain with certain operating characteristics that can make life challenging. Why would someone with ADHD benefit from counselling?
					People mistakenly believe that seeing a counsellor is a reflection of weakness.</p>
				<p>People with ADHD can benefit from education about the way their brain works and an understanding of how their ADHD interacts with all of the other facets of their personality.
					To be respected for their strengths as they work to cope with their weaknesses. They may benefit from developing a clearer direction and purpose in their lives. Counselling should help you in finding ways of doing what you like and minimising what you dislike.</p>

				<p class="first">Learning to work with the effects of medication. If you choose to use medication and it works for you, you may still need to learn how to change the way you approach life with a brain that is now working differently.
					For a host of reasons, people with ADHD are much more likely to develop problems with depression, anxiety, substance use, or problems getting along with others.
					While medication can help these conditions, they also respond to counselling which helps change the root causes of these conditions.</p>
				<p>Sometimes medication can have the somewhat disconcerting effect of increasing a person's awareness of some of the things that they are unhappy about. A fair number of people with ADHD have learned to use their inherent fogginess to prevent them from confronting some distasteful aspects of their life.
					Counselling can help these people face these issues directly and make positive change. Another important aspect of counselling is related to working out the struggles that are often created in relationships.</p>

				<p class="first">While partners with ADHD can be wonderfully exciting, sensitive, warm, and caring they can also be highly inconsistent, distracted, seemingly disinterested, avoidant, and sometimes struggle to communicate.</p>
				<p>ADHD should never be used as an excuse for destructive behaviour, but it can make a very large difference to a relationship when both partners understand the contribution of this neurological condition and how they both can manage it more effectively.</p>
