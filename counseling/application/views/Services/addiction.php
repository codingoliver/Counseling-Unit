				<h2>What is Addiction and how does addiction counselling help?</h2>
				<p class="first">​Addiction can take many forms, Alcohol, Gambling, Shopping, Sex and Exercise are just a few examples of issues which can become an addiction. Any addiction usually has an underlying reason, specialised addiction counselling is the most effective way of getting the help required.</p>
				<p>An addiction is a regular compulsion, some specific activity which is usually damaging to our life balance and well-being, often we may not realise the behaviour or addiction is causing a problem until it is serious.
					It is often a friend or family member that observes a problem long before the person with the addiction does. Addiction counselling helps and it’s important an addiction counsellor with specific skills is sought.</p>
				<p class="info">The term addiction is often used more commonly for drug and alcohol misuse but it is applied to other habits such as gambling, pornography, social network, sex or eating disorders. </p>
				<p>Something tends to be described as an addiction when it interferes with our ‘normal’ everyday tasks and routines, things like our work, career’s or our relationships with others.
					If the addictive behaviour effects our ability to function properly, then it is safe to assume it is an addiction or a problematic behaviour, which may benefit from addiction counselling.</p>
				<p>Addictions may come about as a result of a person having some other issue going on in their lives, sometimes called an underlying issue.
					This is especially the case with alcohol addiction. Alcohol addiction counselling is very effective.</p>

				<h2>Alcohol &amp; Drugs</h2>
				<p class="first">Alcohol & Drugs can be effective in numbing pain, both physical and emotional. Many people start using alcohol and or drugs as a strategy for blocking out pain and whist the strategy may block out the underlying issue, be it emotional or physical pain, it also brings it’s own unique problems.
					Physical and psychological dependency to alcohol and or drugs and several physical ailments may result from excessive or prolonged periods of drinking and or drug taking or the use of other prescribed or illicit medicines.
					It is vital that specific addiction counselling is sought.</p>

				<h2>Physical Addiction</h2>
				<p class="first">Physical addiction on a substance is defined by the appearance of characteristic withdrawal symptoms when the substance or behaviour is suddenly stopped. While Opioids, Benzodiazepines, Barbiturates, Alcohol and Nicotine are all well known for their ability to Induce physical dependence, other categories of substances share this property and are not considered addictive.</p>

				<h2>Smoking (Nicotine addiction)</h2>
				<p class="first">Smokers report that a cigarette can be pleasurable, but there is a medical consensus that the user is likely fulfilling his/her physical addiction and, therefore, is achieving pleasurable feelings relative to his/her previous state of physical withdrawal.
					The physical dependency of the nicotine addict on the substance itself becomes an overwhelming factor in the continuation of most users’ addictions.</p>
				<p>Addiction counselling helps to address the underlying life issues which can lead to addictions. An experienced counsellor (therapist) will be able to offer safe and tested advice and addiction counselling for all addictions.</p>

				<h2>Emotional addiction</h2>
				<p class="first">Psychological addiction is a dependency of the mind, and leads to psychological withdrawal symptoms (such as cravings, irritability, insomnia, depression, anorexia etc).
					Addiction can in theory be derived from any rewarding behaviour and is believed to be strongly associated with the dopaminergic system of the brain’s reward system (as in the case of cocaine and amphetamines). </p>

				<h2>Sex &amp; Porn Addiction issues<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">Worried you have a sex addiction? Whether you feel you are addicted to porn, or you feel you have an unhealthy sex addiction or a problematic sex drive (very low or very high).
