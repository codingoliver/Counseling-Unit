				<h2>What is Body Dysmorphic Disorder?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">Almost everyone has felt unhappy about the way they look at some point in their life, however these feelings usually come and go and get forgotten once we accept our appearance and grow into our own.</p>
				<p>For someone suffering with body dysmorphic disorder however, the thought of being unattractive is incredibly distressing and does not go away. The person believes that they are flawed, defected or even deformed - and they believe that other people perceive them in this way too.
					Even when friends and family members try to convince the person that they look great, the negative thoughts remain overwhelming.</p>

				<h3>Who does it affect?</h3>
				<p class="first">The disorder can affect all age groups, though it typically starts during puberty when people are most sensitive about the way they look. It is thought that body dysmorphic disorder affects more women than men, but with more and more men speaking out about mental illness, these numbers may change.</p>
				<h3>What causes body dysmorphic disorder?</h3>
				<p class="first">Like many anxiety disorders, BDD has no clear-cut cause. Genetics may play a part or there could be a chemical imbalance in the brain. Those with a tendency to anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) may also be more likely to develop body dysmorphic disorder. </p>
				<p>In some cases those with an eating disorder can develop body dysmorphic disorder and vice-versa, however the two are not the same condition. Past experience could also contribute to the condition, especially if the person was bullied or teased about an aspect of their appearance when they were younger.</p>

				<h2>Symptoms of Dysmorphic Disorder<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p>Body dysmorphic disorder is similar to OCD as it causes sufferers to obsess and pick up routines or compulsions. There is usually a particular area of concern for the sufferer:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Facial features (nose, eyes, chin, skin, lips).</li>
					<li>Hair.</li>
					<li>Particular areas of the body such as the breasts, chest ,legs or stomach.</li>
					<li>Feeling as if your body/face is unbalanced.</li>
					<li>Feeling as if one of your features is out of proportion to the rest of the body/face.</li>
				</ul>
