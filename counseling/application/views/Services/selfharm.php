				<h2>Why do people self harm?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p>There are lots of reasons why people might self-harm. The need to hurt yourself usually comes from emotions that are very difficult to cope with or express .
					People might self-harm because it's a way of releasing tension or controlling something. It’s a physical pain that you can deal with, rather than an emotional feeling that you might find hard to cope with.</p>
				<p>Self-harm can also be used as a way of self-punishment for something you feel bad about. The reasons for self-harming can be very personal so it's okay if you don't know why you self-harm.
					Whatever you're going through, I’m here for you. You don’t have to deal with things on your own. </p>

				<ul>
					<li>Cutting or scratching.</li>

					Other people self-harm because of pressure in life or because they feel alone. It doesn't have to be a big thing. An argument or a situation that made them feel embarrassed or left you feeling depressed might lead to someone self-harming.</p>
