				<h2>What is Bereavement?</h2>
				<p class="first">Bereavement is a distressing but common experience. Sooner or later most of us will suffer the death or loss of someone we love. Yet in our everyday lives we think and talk about death and loss very little.</p>
				<p>We do not have much opportunity to learn about grieving or grief, or how it feels, what are the right things to do, what is ‘normal’  or how to come to terms with it.
					In spite of this we have no choice but to cope when we are finally faced with the death or the passing of someone we love. Bereavement counselling can help to move you through the cycles of grief, whilst being supported by a caring professional.</p>

				<h2>The grieving cycle<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">Bereavement is not just one feeling, but a whole host of feelings and emotions, which take a while to get through and which cannot be hurried. Although we are all individuals, the order in which we experience these feelings can be just as different. </p>
				<p>In the few hours or days following the death of someone significant, people might feel simply stunned, or in shock, as though they cannot believe it has actually happened.
					They may feel like this even if the death has been expected. This sense of emotional numbness can be a help in getting through all the important practical arrangements that have to be made, such as getting in touch with relatives and organising the funeral, burial, cremation or other tradition, however, this feeling of unreality may become a problem if it goes on too long, if it feels that way, you could consider bereavement counselling even in the early stages of grieving.</p>

				<h2>The grieving cycle<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">​Soon though, this numbness can disappear and may be replaced by a dreadful sense of agitation, of pining or yearning for the dead person. There is a feeling of wanting somehow to find them, even though this is clearly impossible.
					This makes it difficult to relax or concentrate and it may be difficult to sleep properly. Dreams may be extremely disturbing. Some people feel that they ‘see’ their loved one everywhere they go, in the street, the park, around the house, anywhere they had spent time together.
					People often feel very angry at this time – towards doctors and nurses who did not prevent the death, towards friends and relatives who did not do enough, or even towards the person who has left them.</p>
				<p>Another common feeling is guilt. People find themselves going over in their minds all the things they would have liked to have said or done.
					They may even consider what they could have done differently that might have prevented the death. Of course, death is usually beyond anyone’s control and a bereaved person may need to be reminded of this.
					Guilt may also arise if a sense of relief is felt when someone has died after a particularly painful or distressing illness. This feeling of relief is natural, extremely understandable and very common. </p>
				<h3>Bereavement counselling can help you work through these complex feelings.</h3>

				<h2>The stages of grieving<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<h3>Denial</h3>
				<p class="first">Is a conscious or unconscious refusal to accept facts, information, reality. It’s a defence mechanism and perfectly natural. Some people can become locked in this stage when dealing with a traumatic change that can be ignored, bereavement counselling can help with this.
					Death of course is not particularly easy to avoid or evade indefinitely.</p>
				<h3>Anger</h3>
				<p class="first">Can manifest in different ways. People dealing with emotional upset can be angry with themselves, and/or with others, especially those close to them. Knowing this helps keep detached and non-judgemental when experiencing the anger of someone who is very upset.
					Anger linked bereavement counselling is effective and will help you to move on through the stages of grief.</p>

				<h2>The stages of grieving<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
				<h3>Depression</h3>
				<p class="first">In a way it’s the dress rehearsal or the practice run for the ‘aftermath’ although this stage means different things depending on whom it involves. It’s a sort of acceptance with emotional attachment.
					It’s natural to feel sadness and regret, fear, uncertainty. It shows that the person has at least begun to accept the reality.</p>
				<h3>Acceptance</h3>
				<p class="first">Again this stage definitely varies according to the person’s situation. People dying can enter this stage a long time before the people they leave behind, who must necessarily pass through their own individual stages of dealing with the grief.
					Whilst the dying person may have accepted their passing, their loved ones may need a lot of support, bereavement counselling offers this suppor</p>

				<h2>How bereavement may feel<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p>A state of agitation, or numbness but it soon can be followed by times of quiet sadness. Stress and or depression, withdrawal and silence. These sudden changes of emotion can be confusing to friends or relatives but are just part of the normal way of passing through the different stages of grief.
					Although the agitation lessens, spasms of grief can occur at any time, sparked off by people, places or things that bring back memories of the dead person. Other people may find it difficult to understand or embarrassing when the bereaved person suddenly bursts into tears for no obvious reason.</p>
				<p>At this stage it may be tempting to keep away from other people who do not fully understand or share the grief. However, avoiding others can store up trouble for the future and it is usually best to try to start to get back into your routine</p>

				<h2>How bereavement may feel<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">During this time, it may appear to others as though the bereaved person is spending a lot of time just sitting, doing nothing. In fact, they are usually thinking about the person they have lost, going over again and again both the good times and the bad times they had together.
					This is a quiet but essential part of coming to terms with the death.</p>
				<p>As time passes, the fierce pain of early bereavement begins to fade. The depression lessens and it is possible to think about other things and even to look again to the future.
					However, the sense of having lost a part of oneself never goes away entirely.</p>
				<p class="important">Having said this, there is no ‘standard’ way of grieving. We are all individuals and have our own particular ways of grieving. Bereavement counselling is therefore personalised to your needs.</p>

				<h2>How bereavement may feel<b class="pull-right">(3)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">After some time it is possible to feel whole again, even though a part of you is missing. Even so, years later you may sometimes find yourself talking as though he or she were still here with you, again this is natural.
					Bereavement counselling is appropriate at any time, it may be weeks, months or years after, but it always helps to talk to a bereavement counsellor.</p>
				<p>Grief is a process by which our mind heals this hurt. For us to go on with our lives and again risk caring about others, we need to let go of those we love who are no longer with us in body.
					Through this process of mourning, we gradually accept the loss.</p>
				<p>At the end of mourning, there is still sadness, but it is a reflective sadness that is tempered by the happy memories that we still possess. Bereavement counselling can help you move forward.</p>
