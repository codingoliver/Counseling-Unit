				<h2>What is Anorexia Nervosa?</h2>
				<p class="first">Anorexia nervosa causes the sufferer to fear weight gain and restrict their diet in an unhealthy way. An individual with anorexia is likely to perceive themselves as overweight, even if they are of a normal or below normal weight.
					This distorted perception combined with other emotional factors typically lead to the sufferer limiting their intake of food and effectively starving themselves to get to the lowest weight possible.</p>
				<p>The condition often stems from low self-esteem and an inability to cope or manage difficult feelings. Those with anorexia may believe that they will only be happy once they reach a certain weight, but sadly this is rarely the case.
					Soon the eating disorder takes over, becoming a habitual coping mechanism that is difficult to stop.</p>
				<p>If you have anorexia, it may feel as if there is no way out - but there are many professionals out there who can support you during your recovery. Whether it is yourself you are concerned about or a loved one.</p>

				<h2>Symptoms of Anorexia Nervosa<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">If you have an eating disorder, one of the key symptoms will be the way you think about food. Rather than viewing food as something to enjoy or to provide sustenance, you are likely to view food in a negative way.
					You may see it as something that makes you fat, something to avoid and even something that frightens you. Your thoughts are also likely to revolve around your weight, body shape and the way you feel about them.</p>
				<h3>Common behavioural symptoms of anorexia include:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Being dishonest about what or when you have eaten.</li>
					<li>Wearing baggy clothes to hide your body.</li>
					<li>Cooking for others, but not eating yourself.</li>
					<li>Feeling eager to please others.</li>
					<li>Exercising excessively to compensate for eating.</li>
					<li>Feeling fearful of high-calorie foods.</li>
					<li>Skipping meals or only eating low-calorie foods.</li>
					<li>Constantly weighing yourself.</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Previous experience with Anorexia Nervosa</h2>
				<p class="first">I have worked in the field of eating disorders counselling and therapy for several years both face to face and online counselling. I have helped many clients who struggle with food and the subsequent behaviours such as anorexia and bulimia which can affect peopleâ€™s lives,
					focusing on the underlying life issues which contribute to food related problems helps clients to learn to live a life free of the debilitating problematic use of food</p>
				<p class="important">Most food related issues are a result of unresolved psychological issues from our pasts, I will help clients to find closure to these issues.</p>
