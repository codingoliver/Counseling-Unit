				<h2>What is an eating disorder?</h2>
				<p class="first">Food and eating disorders or eating problems are caused by a deep rooted emotional feelings and self beliefs. Low self-esteem plays a part in why people use food to try to control their lives.
					We all vary in the foods we like, how much we need to eat, and when we like to eat. Food is essential for our health, development and our well-being both physically and emotionally.
					We all tend to comfort eat at times of stress or sadness. Anorexia, bulimia and binge eating are very damaging illnesses and require specialist psychological help,
					I have worked with many clients and supported them to bring their illness or eating disorder under control.</p>

				<p class="first">Problems with food can begin when it is used to cope with those times when you are bored, anxious, angry, lonely, ashamed or sad. Food becomes a problem when it is used to help you to cope with painful situations or feelings, or to relieve stress perhaps without you even realising it.</p>
				<p>If this is how you deal with emotions and feelings and you are unhappy about it, then you should try to talk to someone you trust. Talking to a counsellor is a good choice, I will offer you confidentiality and support.
					Try not to bottle things up – this is not helpful to you or other people around you, it won’t make you feel any better and the problem is unlikely to go away.</p>
				<p>It is unlikely that an eating disorder will result from a single cause. It is much more likely to be a combination of many factors, events, feelings or pressures which lead to you feeling unable to cope.</p>
