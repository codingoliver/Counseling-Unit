				<h2>What is Binge-Eating Disorder?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">Binge-eating disorder is a form of compulsive overeating that is effecting a growing number of people globally. Sufferers feel a compulsion to consume large quantities of food on a regular basis.
					They may not feel able to control their desire to binge and may eat even if they are not hungry. Binges are usually planned and can involve specially purchased 'bingeing' foods. </p>
				<p>Episodes of binge-eating typically take place in private and can last for a number of hours. Some may binge all day long, feeling powerless to stop no matter how full they become.
					Often binge eaters will feel extremely distressed and upset - consumed with guilt over their lack of control. This shame can prevent sufferers from seeking help, but may also be a sign of underlying emotional issues.
					I will not judge you, I am here for you. </p>

				<h2>What is Binge-Eating Disorder?<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">Although only recently recognised as a separate condition, binge-eating disorder is considered the most common eating disorder. Unlike other eating disorders such as anorexia, it equally affects men and women of all ages.
					It can, tend to be more common in adults than young people, and a particularly high percentage of adults in their 40s and 50s have the disorder. </p>

				<h2>Causes of binge-eating disorders<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<h3>Stress</h3>
				<p class="first">Extensive research has shown that mood triggers our impulse to eat. In regards to binge-eating disorder, stress and anxiety are considered among the most common triggers.
					Typically, a number of sufferers will resort to overeating as a short-term release from the ups and downs of life - particularly distressing experiences and personal difficulties that put great strain on their mental well-being.
					Food provides a soothing and comforting escape, although binge-eating is a far more destructive form of comfort eating</p>
				<h3>Depression</h3>
				<p class="first">Depression and binge-eating disorder are strongly linked. According to the NHS, nearly 50% of all binge-eating disorder sufferers have had depression at one point in their life.
					However depression can also be an effect of binge-eating disorder as well as a cause.</p>

				<h3>Pressure to diet </h3>
				<p>Social pressure to be thin can also add to the shame and inadequacy sufferers feel, and this can fuel their emotional eating - especially if they are unable to achieve their desired body shape.
					Poor body image will also trigger more intense feelings of guilt following a binge, which will further exacerbate the problem. In some cases, the stage can be set for binge-eating during childhood - especially if parents unwittingly use food to comfort, dismiss or reward their children.
					Children who are exposed to critical comments about their bodies and/or weight may also be more susceptible to developing the disorder.</p>

				<h2>Previous experience with Binge-Eating</h2>
				<p class="first">I have worked in the field of eating disorders counselling and therapy for several years both face to face and online counselling. I have helped many clients who struggle with food and the subsequent behaviours such as anorexia and bulimia which can affect peopleâ€™s lives, focusing on the underlying life issues which contribute to food related problems
					I can help clients to learn to live a life free of the debilitating problematic use of food. Most food related issues are a result of unresolved psychological issues from our pasts,
					I can help you to find closure.</p>
