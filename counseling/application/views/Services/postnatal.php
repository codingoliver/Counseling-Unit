				<h2>What is Post Natal Depression</h2>
				<p class="first">Postnatal depression (PND) is a common problem. It was thought that about one in ten mums suffers from PND but many recent studies have indicated that it may affect  as many as one in five.
					PND can sometimes be confused with the 'baby blues' which affects at least 80% of new mums and which are thought to be due to the huge hormonal changes that occur after birth.</p>
				<p>However, whereas baby blues can resolve quite quickly, PND is unlikely to go away without the right support and treatment. Postnatal depression can include difficulties in bonding with your baby but this is absolutely not always the case.</p>
