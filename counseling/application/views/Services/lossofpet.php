				<h3>Denial</h3>
				<p class="first">Is a conscious or unconscious refusal to accept facts, information, reality. It’s a defence mechanism and perfectly natural. Some people can become locked in this stage when dealing with a traumatic change that can be ignored, bereavement counselling can help with this.
					Death of course is not particularly easy to avoid or evade indefinitely.</p>
				<h3>Anger</h3>
				<p class="first">Can manifest in different ways. People dealing with emotional upset can be angry with themselves, and/or with others, especially those close to them. Knowing this helps keep detached and non-judgemental when experiencing the anger of someone who is very upset.
					Anger linked bereavement counselling is effective and will help you to move on through the stages of grief.</p>

				<h3>Depression</h3>
				<p class="first">In a way it’s the dress rehearsal or the practice run for the ‘aftermath’ although this stage means different things depending on whom it involves. It’s a sort of acceptance with emotional attachment.
					It’s natural to feel sadness and regret, fear, uncertainty. It shows that the person has at least begun to accept the reality.</p>
				<h3>Acceptance</h3>
				<p class="first">Again this stage definitely varies according to the person’s situation. People dying can enter this stage a long time before the people they leave behind, who must necessarily pass through their own individual stages of dealing with the grief.
					Whilst the dying person may have accepted their passing, their loved ones may need a lot of support, bereavement counselling offers this suppor</p>

				<h2>Losing a pet</h2>
				<p class="first">When our pet and special friendship dies it can be very difficult, few people truly understand what the death of a beloved pet really means, unless they happen to be an animal lover and a pet loss counsellor.
					We love our pets, whether we call him/her a friend, faithful companion, or by their name, the special lifetime bond between human and animal is unique. A special connection in life that is as unconditional as the relationship between us and our beloved pet.
					Often they may be our sole companion or part of the family.</p>
				<p>When such a loving and cherished relationship comes to an end because of illness, theft, or old age the emotions and loss can be one of the most significant losses we are likely to experience in our lives.
					At times like this finding the right person to talk to about our grief, who understands the extent of the loss can be difficult. Some people may fail to see the special bond between an animal and a human and therefore not fully empathise with the loss of a pet.</p>
				<p>Bereavement whether it be human or animal requires specific understanding and empathy, when the loss is of loved and loyal animal, then it takes the compassion of a real animal lover to fully understand the impact such a loss can have on one’s life and well being.
					I have had the privilege of loving and being loved by animals all of my life and know the joys of having and the pain of losing a beloved companion. I understand what pet grief means and can help other animal lovers work through their grief in a sympathetic and empathic manner.</p>
