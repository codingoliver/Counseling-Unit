				<h2>What is PTSD?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">​If you are involved in, or witness a traumatic event, it is common to experience upsetting, distressing or confusing feelings afterwards. The feelings of distress may not emerge straight away – you may just feel emotionally numb at first.
					After a while you may develop emotional and physical reactions, such as feeling easily upset or not being able to sleep.</p>
				<p>This is understandable, and many people find that these symptoms disappear in a relatively short period of time. But if your problems last for longer than a month, or are very extreme, you may be given a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).</p>
				<p>There’s no time limit on distress, and some people may not develop post-traumatic symptoms until many years after the event. Additionally, not everyone who has experienced a traumatic event develops PTSD.</p>

				<h2>​​What causes PTSD?</h2>
				<p class="first">The situations we find traumatic can vary from person to person and different events can lead to PTSD. It may be that your responses have been bottled up for a long time after the traumatic event has passed.
					Your problems may only emerge months or sometimes years after a traumatic experience, affecting your ability to lead your life as you’d like to.</p>
				<h3>A traumatic event could include:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>A serious accident, for example a car crash.</li>
					<li>An event where you fear for your life.</li>
					<li>Being physically assaulted.</li>
					<li>Being raped or sexually assaulted.</li>
					<li>Abuse in childhood.</li>
					<li>A traumatic childbirth, either as a mother or a partner witnessing a traumatic birth.</li>
					<li>Extreme violence or war.</li>
					<li>Military combat.</li>
					<li>Seeing people hurt or killed.</li>
					<li>A natural disaster, such as flooding or an earthquake.</li>
					<li>Losing someone close to you in disturbing circumstances.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>​After a traumatic event you may feel numb, dazed and disorientated. Many people find it hard to accept what has happened to them and you may behave as though nothing bad has happened.
					This response may allow you time away from the trauma and you may subconsciously be beginning to process what you have been through. When you feel ready, you may find the following ideas helpful.</p>
