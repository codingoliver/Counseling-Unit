				<p>I offer an online counselling service combining humanistic counselling (person centred) with CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) strategies to help clients change their lives for the better.</p>
				<p>Before I became a counsellor I found myself struggling with the changes and challenges that came into my life, and life was no longer familiar, I didn’t know where to turn, I struggled with life and my issues for a couple of years.
				Eventually I found the courage to talk to a counsellor, obviously confidentiality was very important to me.</p>
