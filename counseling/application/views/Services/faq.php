								<p>For many people online counselling is an ideal way of seeking confidential, professional, counselling help and support.
									You won’t have to travel to work with a professional counsellor, you can respond in your own time and you don’t need to let others know that you are seeking counselling or therapy.
									No one will ever see you entering a counselling room, so there is a higher level of confidentiality.</p>
								<p>It may seem strange at first not to talk to a counsellor face to face, however that can be one of online counselling’s greatest attractions too.
									You can be as anonymous as you want to be and access an online counsellor from the convenience of your own home or work place, in fact anywhere you have an internet connection, many people are now accessing online counselling via public libraries and even from their smartphones.</p>
								<p>The other important consideration of online counselling is that Counsellors online now offers the most affordable counselling online available anywhere,
									These are all very good reasons to choose online counselling.</p>

								<p> Sometimes online counselling clients can be helped to see a way forward quite quickly, most people will see or feel a difference after the first session, often they describe being filled with hope.
									The experienced counsellor will want to help you in as shorter time as possible, whilst allowing you time and space to go at the pace that seems appropriate for you.</p>
								<p>From time to time I will ask you how you are finding the online counselling process and if you feel we are working in the right way and at the correct pace for you.
									I am trained to help you focus on your most urgent issues, whilst having the flexibility to work on and explore what life is throwing at you in the present time.</p>

								<p>All problems are important big or small, if it is a problem for you then it can be helpful to talk about it  with a qualified online counsellor in total confidence.
									We can work together to stop a crisis happening by addressing the small problems before they become a big issue.</p>
								<p>Preventing a crisis is always easier than dealing with it when you are in the middle of it.
									Talking always helps and a problem shared with a counsellor, is most often a problem solved.</p>
