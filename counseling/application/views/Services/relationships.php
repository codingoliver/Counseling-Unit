				<h2>Relationship Issues</h2>
				<p class="first">The ‘In Love’ stage of a relationship is something which cannot easily go unnoticed, we glow and shine like no other life event. When we feel in love it feels so special and we are the envy of our friends who have either been there or have maybe never yet felt it.
					For the ones which have been there, they may be able to shed some light on what happens when the ‘in love’ feelings change.</p>

				<h2>Why doesn’t the feeling of being in love last forever?</h2>
				<p class="first">The answer is all to do with our brains and the chemical it releases into our bloodstream, Phenethylamine (sometimes referred to as the love drug) is released into our blood stream on average for the first four years of an intense intimate relationship, usually when we are with or around our partner.</p>

				<h3>So if relationship break ups &amp; divorces are not down to chemicals, what can be done to help?<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h3>
				<p class="first">Our personal issues are the single biggest reason why we struggle to have a happy, long lasting relationship, it’s not the fading of the ‘love drug’ as most people know, the in love stage is simply that, a beautiful but temporary period in a longer lasting journey together. so knowing and resolving our own issues is important within a relationship.</p>
				<p>But what about our partner, the person we have chosen to spend our life with, maybe they have personal issues too. Its a fact that we don’t really get to know people very well until we are living with them and the flame has faded, when the love drug has diminished, that’s when such problems usually show themselves</p>
				<p>For people thinking about getting married or entering into a civil partnership, before you say ‘I Do’ it’ may be wise and helpful to have some relationship counselling, to look at ways of helping each other through the challenges ahead and exploring any possible difficulties before they develop into a relationship nightmare.</p>

				<h3>So if relationship break ups &amp; divorces are not down to chemicals, what can be done to help?<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h3>
				<p class="first">Maybe you have already started to plan your wedding or civil partnership, this will be an exciting and most likely a stressful time with lots to arrange. If you are fortunate enough to have friends, family and the finances to pay people to help you with some of ‘the must’ have wedding day frills, this will seem like a necessary price to pay for what will be a perfect day.
					You may however still be under a great deal of stress.</p>
				<p>If you know what to expect and how your relationship will grow and change over time, then you will be better prepared to deal with it and adapt more easily to the unavoidable changes in yourself and in the relationship.</p>
				<p>Talking to a professional who understands attachment (the way we connect with others) and relationships, is the best way to prepare for a successful relationship, civil partnership or marriage and not least do your very best to join the ever growing number of couples who find the pressures too much to handle.</p>
