				<h2>Losing a child<b class="pull-right">(1)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">It is a given in today’s world that parents die before their children, so the grief that comes from the death of a child is like no other. This loss can be accompanied by overwhelming feelings of dread and disbelief, and a parent can take a long time to accept it.
					Grief is universal, yet ultimately very personal. Everyone grieves differently; some may wish to push their feelings back, while others will cope by talking about their child all the time.
					The loss of one child can alter the relationship with other children in the family</p>
				<p>For some parents it can bring them closer to the remaining children, for others it can make them more distant. They can become anxious and overprotective, fearing another loss.
					If the child was an only child, the loss can be even more unbearable, bringing with it a feeling that they have lost everything. Birthdays and Christmas can be especially painful reminders of the loss and a new upsurge of grief can be expected on these occasions.
					These anniversaries can become easier to cope with as time passes.</p>

				<h2>Losing a child<b class="pull-right">(2)</b></h2>
				<p class="first">The other children may feel lost and confused, not knowing how to react to this unfamiliar situation. They may feel excluded as all the energy of the grown up's is directed towards their bereavement.
					They might think they are to blame for what has happened, or may not be able to put the whirlpool of emotions they are experiencing into words. Within a family crisis like this, the other children can be ignored in the torrent of grief as being too young to understand what is happening.
					They may be too young, but they understand that something is happening.</p>
				<h3>Age of your lost child makes no difference</h3>
				<p class="first">When a child of any age dies, parents and carers lose much more than a precious son, daughter or family member. Life as they knew it has been irreversibly changed.
					They lose a future which included a child they nurtured, cared for, loved and who has now been cruelly taken away from them. With younger children the milestones are different from those of a teenager, or a young adult, but the pain surrounding shattered dreams is no less whatever the age.</p>

				<h3>How you might be feeling</h3>
				<p class="first">Everyone is different and everyone grieves the death of a child in their own way. What you feel is what you feel. That doesn’t make your response right or wrong, it is just how you are.
					Grief is made up of a surprising number of responses of varying intensity. It is normal to shed a few tears, sob uncontrollably, do neither, or anything in between.
					There is no set formula and no predictable time scale.</p>
				<h3>Some common responses can include:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Complete exhaustion, particularly in the early days.</li>
					<li>Physical aches including a tightness in the throat or chest.</li>
					<li>Being unable to concentrate on anything else making the simplest task a challenge.</li>
					<li>A sense of “what’s the point?“ to life, a feeling of complete helplessness.</li>
					<li>A great void or emptiness that will never be filled.</li>
					<li>Feeling that life will never again hold any pleasure or happiness.</li>
				</ul>

					<li>Help resolve areas of conflict still remaining.</li>
					<li>Help you to adjust to a new sense of self.</li>
					<li>Address possible issues of depression or suicidal thoughts.</li>

				<h2>Bereavement counselling</h2>
				<p class="first">You will never stop missing the child you lost, but with enough time and the right support, life can be pieced back together. Bereavement counselling aims to get you to the point where you can function normally - however long it takes.
					One day, you may be able to find happiness again. By creating a place to keep the child you lost, and finding ways to remember them, you can preserve their memory, honour and the impact they had on your life, without letting their absence obscure your own future.</p>
				<p class="important">With time, together we can help the pain fade.</>
